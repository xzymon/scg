# Simple Card Game (scg)
This project is intended to proof the concept of implementation of card game as web application.

It is intended to consist of 2 areas: FE (frond-end) and BE (back-end), which communicate by websockets.

It has to be simple (at least - as a proof of concept) - so it uses pure Java Servlets (on back-end) and pure JavaScript(on front-end).
